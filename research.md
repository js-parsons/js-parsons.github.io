- This is the original article introducing the concept of constructing python code by dragging and dropping code fragments and the first prototype of js-parsons.

- Do students backtrack or go in circles in their solution paths, i.e., do the solution paths have loops where students return to an earlier state in their solution path? How can these loops be characterized?
-  How do students use automatic feedback? When and how often do they ask for feedback? How can the situations when they use feedback be characterized?

In *Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering (LaTiCE), 2013, pp. 55-61*. ([link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.26))

- We have extended js-parsons with what we call execution-based feedback where tests are run on learner’s code and then checked for expected results. In our implementation, the Python code is executed directly within the browser environment.
- We have compared the new execution-based feedback and the previously existing line-based feedback in terms of how students use feedback and how it affects their behavior while solving the problems.

- How to adapt Parsons problems to mobile devices with smaller screens and touch interaction?
- How to both provide meaningful feedback on (partial) solutions to Parsons problems and discourage undesired problem solving behavior?

- allow more choice in how programs are constructed by allowing some choice in and modifications to the given code through toggleable elements in the code fragments
